									<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
									<p>At the University of South Florida excelling in master of science in Business Analytics and Information Systems, I have engaged in a variety of projects that have sharpened my skills in Business Intelligence and Data Analysis. Leveraging tools such as Tableau, Natural Language Inference (NLI), Machine Learning, and Python, I have tackled real-world challenges. My projects range from analyzing U.S. recessions to exploring multilingual text relationships through NLI frameworks, and building predictive models for public health concerns like monkeypox and abnormal heart rates. This academic journey has not only enhanced my technical expertise but also deepened my passion for collaborative problem-solving.</p>

			financial stability, their inability to innovate to expand its customer base, the functional limitations of
			their operating systems, their industry competitions, among many others. This case study can serve as a lesson for tech companies that become complacent after experiencing success.</p>

											<p>The article highlights the issue of algorithmic bias and presents practical solutions to minimize its impact. This is a crucial issue for the future because AI is becoming more and more widespread in various fields, such as hiring, criminal justice, and social media. (Designing AI for All, p. 1) It is vital to understand and reduce algorithmic bias to ensure that AI systems are just unbiased, and responsible. Ultimately, this will create a future where technology benefits everyone and does not perpetuate societal biases.</p>
